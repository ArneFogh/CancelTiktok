  <h2>What is so dangerous about Tiktok?</h2>
  <p>Let's start by dividing that up into two questions: What are the dangers for the average user,
    and why are Tiktok potentially harmfull to the western world? - Let's find out</p>
  <p><span>1. Tiktok is collecting a lot of data:</span> Maybe you don't care much about Tiktok
    gathering information about what type of videos you like and don't.</p>

  <p>But they collect much more data than that, let's just focus on the more important types of
    data the Chinese owned company collects. In their privacy policy, Tiktok states that it collects
    <p1>"information you provide in the context of composing, sending, or receiving messages."</p1>
    Which means Tiktok does not just collect the data and messages that you have shared using the
    app, but also content you created or wrote but <span>didn't share.</span></p>

  <p><span>What else does Tiktok collect and who have access to that data?</span>
    Tiktok is also gathering information about what phone you use, the screen resolution,
    what operation system you're on, your phone number, email address, location and even your contact list.</p>

  <p>Tiktok stores their users data in the US and Singapore, but since the company is owned by the Chinese company
    ByteDance, they are required by law to share all their data with the Chinese government, if they ask for it.</p>

  <p><span>2. Tiktok is in the eyes of hackers:</span> Since Tiktok stores so much information about so many people,
    many hackers have had their eyes on it for a while now.</p>

  <p>Your personal information is increasing in price everyday and is now worth much more than you can imagine.
    Most companies just wants your data to more precisely know what you might be interested in, to buy.</p>

  <p>Researchers have found multiple security vulnerabilities within the app over the past few years.
    TikTok uses HTTP connection to deliver videos on, which is much more vulnerable than the more secure option, HTTPS.</p>

  <p>Hackers have found a way to send a direct message to a user on Tiktok, and when clicked on,
    they now have access to all of their account. Which gives hackers and cybercriminals the ability
    to spread propaganda and manipulate users feeds, plant unsolicited content that could be misleading
    or disturbing, especially for younger people using Tiktok.</p>
