  <h2>1. Privacy data issues</h2>
  <p>In Tiktok's privacy policy, we already see the first issues regarding your personal
    data and how Tiktok is collecting it.</p>
  <p>It's a free app, so you have to be prepared to volunteer some of your personal data.
    But is TikTok taking this too far?</p>

  <p>TikTok's current privacy policy says that it collects "technical and behavioral information
    about your use of the platform", whether you're a content creator or use the app just to watch videos.</p>

  <img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/laptop_with_binary_code_and_the_flag_of_china_by_smederevac_gettyimages-1137730846_2400x1600-100858220-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70" alt="Chinese flag with code" srcset="">

  <p>If you upload content, besides the usual things, TikTok also has the right to "identify
    the objects and scenery that appear" and collect and process "the existence and location within
    an image of face and body features and attributes". Which is very creepy! This means that the Chinese
    state has the ability to collect data about much more than how much time you spend on the app and
    what you like. But also the content of what you upload and what is in your room or in the area you
    film in. Not only that, they also collect data about the things that happen on the videos you like
    and save, such as what body types you liked.</p>

  <p>It's also worth noting that if you link your TikTok account to another service, it may receive information
    about your use of that service. If you link your TikTok account to another social media platform,
    the app may collect info about your use of that service, essentially gaining access to most of your online presence.</p>

  <p>TikTok also shares your information with third-party service providers, business partners,
    and other companies in the same group, amongst others. The app stores user data in the US and
    Singapore, but as it's owned by a Chinese company, it is legally required to submit the data
    to the government if asked.</p>

  <h2>2. Potential effects on your brain</h2>
  <p>Even tho it is not yet banned in the US, more and more studies link TikTok to a decreased
    attention span in young people, especially those under 24.</p>

  <p>Being subjected to extremely short-form entertainment can affect the not-fully-developed
    human brains in ways that are still not clear. Some suggest TikTok is addictive, while others
    claim that while the platform is "hard to watch, and hard to stop watching".</p>

  <p>Hackers have found a way to send a direct message to a user on Tiktok, and when clicked on,
    they now have access to all of their account. Which gives hackers and cybercriminals the ability
    to spread propaganda and manipulate users feeds, plant unsolicited content that could be misleading
    or disturbing, especially for younger people using Tiktok.</p>

  <p>I will suggest that if you for some reason have this god forbidden app installed on any of
  your devices, get that thing as far away from you as humanly possible.</p>

  <h2>3. Child predators</h2>

  <p>TikTok is full of child predators. There’s likely more than most too because the
    platform is full of children which makes it appealing for these adults to browse.</p>

  <p>A recent study found that children as young as eight were being groomed by predators
    and were also being bombarded with explicit messages from adults. Even if you make your account
    private, predators can still see your profile picture and it doesn’t take much for them to create
    a fake profile to trick children into adding them as a ‘friend’.</p>

  <p>TikTok makes it easy for predators to contact children privately and does a
    poor job of banning them quickly. This is an obvious way TikTok is bad for you, and especially for young children.</p>
