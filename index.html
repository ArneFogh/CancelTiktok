            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Amid a flurry of talking points and takedowns as the United States midterm elections
                loom, lawmakers and regulators have reheated claims about TikTok, a social media app
                they say poses a threat to personal privacy and US national security. Now, the Biden
                administration is reportedly readying its own action. But the exact scope of the problem
                and goals remain fuzzy. Owned by the Chinese tech giant Bytedance, TikTok has more than
                a billion users, including an estimated 135 million in the US, and some lawmakers,
                including former president Donald Trump, have warned over the past two years that the
                Chinese government could use the app to collect data on Americans or launch influence
                operations through the platform.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The US military banned its members from using TikTok on government devices or at all in
                late 2019 and early 2020, as did the Transportation Security Administration and some
                other federal agencies. Just last month, the chief administrative officer for the US
                House of Representatives warned lawmakers against installing TikTok due to the data
                it can collect. This followed a June 17 BuzzFeed News report, which found that ByteDance
                employees can and do gain access to US TikTok users' data in some situations. But for
                the general public, warnings from legislators and regulators this summer have continued
                to be vague and amorphous, underscoring broader ambiguity about where lawmakers'
                precise concerns lie. </p>

            <h2>The importance</h2>
            <p>The most important fact is that we have to get rid of this app, ban it from all platforms inside the US.
            This app is filled with Chinese propaganda, fake news and child predators.</p>
            <p>The chinese government are trying to single us out, one by one and gathering as much information about us,
            from within to destroy what we know as democracy. To protect this country we have to stop promoting these
            chinese corrupt data pirates.</p>
            <p>God knows what the chinese government will use this for, with all this data they know where we all are,
            what we do on our daily basis and how we live our lives. For all I know they could use this data to precisely
            know what shores to attack first to eliminate the majority in the first strike. And as long as this app is running
            the US will never know what hit em.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To protect the people of the US and the democracy itself, we have to start protesting against the use of
            Tiktok. Even tho you don't have the app, as long as you have a phone and one person in your contacts have the app
            installed, they already know everything about you. And am sure you never gave them the clearance to store data
            and know so much about you, if you never installed the app.</p>

            <p>Hackers have found a way to send a direct message to a user on Tiktok, and when clicked on,
                they now have access to all of their account. Which gives hackers and cybercriminals the ability
                to spread propaganda and manipulate users feeds, plant unsolicited content that could be misleading
                or disturbing, especially for younger people using Tiktok.</p>

            <a href="article2.html"><h2>The risks of Tiktok</h2></a>
            <p>A recent study found that children as young as eight were being groomed by predators
                and were also being bombarded with explicit messages from adults. Even if you make your account
                private, predators can still see your profile picture and it doesn’t take much for them to create
                a fake profile to trick children into adding them as a ‘friend’.</p>
